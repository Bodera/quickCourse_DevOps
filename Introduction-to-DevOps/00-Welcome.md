# Lesson #1

## Introduction

At the end of this course you be capable to understand the cultural and cultural transformations required to make this a successful and fruitful initiative.

Similar to [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/), there is [DevOps Institute](https://www.devopsinstitute.com/), which according to themselves it's a continuous learning community around emerging DevOps practices, setting the standard for competency-based training and certification. And they say that the demand for DevOps skills are expected to grow 122% over the next five years, making it one of the fastest-growing skills in the workforce. Adversely, there is one report of [Gartner Group](https://www.gartner.com/en/about) which says that 75% of DevOps initiatives will fail to meet expectations, issues promoted by organizational learning and cultural change. That's because:

DevOps is not a tool or a job title neither. In fact it's the practice of development and operations engineers working together through the entire software development lifecycle, following Lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver software in a rapid and continuous manner. And to do that, you will need to adopt a shared mindset that is at the heart of the DevOps culture.

To change culture you will have to start doing things differently:

- Think differently
    1. Social coding and improving software reuse and sharing.
    2. Working with small batches to reduce waste and others concepts taught in Lean manufacturing.
    3. Creating minimum valuable products to gain valuable insight.
- Work differently
    1. Test driven and behavior driven development techniques to ensure repeatable behavior and high code quality.
    2. How continuous integration and continuous delivery practices ensure that every change contributes to be a potentially shippable feature.
- Organize differently
    1. Organization directly impacts the architecture and design of the products that you produce.
- Measure differently
    1. Measure what matters.
    2. You get what you measure.

> "Tools are not the solution to a cultural problem. Team culture makes a large difference to a team's ability to deliver software and meet or exceed their organizational goals." - DevOps Research and Assessment.

Have you ever heard that, humans have a knack for figuring out what behavior is rewarded, and then doing — or at least pretending to do — that rewarded behavior?

In order to really embrace the DevOps culture, you have to be willing to make changes… lots of changes. You must be willing to experiment and understand that it’s okay if an experiment fails
because “every failure is a learning opportunity.” So, fail fast. You need to foster the core values of teamwork, accountability, and trust.
